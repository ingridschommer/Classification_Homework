# Classification Homework
## In this assignment, I built and evaluated different machine-learning models to predict credit risk using data from LendingClub. I used the imbalanced-learn and Scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using the resampling and ensamble techniques. 

 In the first workbook, I used the imbalanced learn library to resample the LendingClub data and answer the following questions: 
> Which model had the best balanced accuracy score?
>> Of these four models, the Naive Random Oversample model had the best balanced accuracy score of 0.7163908158823367. 

> Which model had the best recall score?
>> Of these four models, the Naive Random Oversample model had the best recall score of 0.71. 

> Which model had the best geometric mean score?
>> Of these four models, the Naive Random Oversample model had the best geometric mean score of 0.72. 

In the second workbook, I trained and compared two different ensemble classifiers to predict loan risk and evaluate each model, using the Balanced Random Forest Classifier and the Easy Ensemble Classifier.
> Which model had the best balanced accuracy score?
>> Of these two models, the Easy Ensemble Classifier model had the best balanced accuracy score of 0.9316600714093861. 

> Which model had the best recall score?
>> Of these two models, the Easy Ensemble Classifier model had the best recall score of 0.94.

>Which model had the best geometric mean score?
>>Of these two models, the Easy Ensemble Classifier model had the best geometric mean score of 0.93.

>What are the top three features?
>>The top three features that impact the riskiness of a loan are the loan amount, the interest rate, and the installment amount.
